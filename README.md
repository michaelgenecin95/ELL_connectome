Connectivity Analysis:
Connectivity wrapper runs analysis on cells downloaded from the shared google drive and creates an image of the connectivity between cells as well as a heatmap of connections by cell type. Be sure to download the cells locally and edit the path at the top of the script to your local path. 

to do: report self-synapses, print cell ID and annotation coordinates
to do: double check any segment over laps to search for duplicate cells
to do: create a version of the heatmap with the unconnected cells removed


Other ideas for the project:
create a web-app for people to check a new cell against previously reconstructed cells online to avoid duplicates
